# Assignment of INKR

Hi team, I try to do some requirements for the assignment. However, I do not have a lot of time to complete the assignment. I push all code in 1 night to my GitHub, I think INKR's team will be pleased with it.

# What have I accomplished?

- Layout for main content and sidebar.
- Show all files and objects (including text and visuals) to the content element.
- Select, move, resize and rotate objects (update data when completing drag action).
